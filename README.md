# Customer Retention & Churn Intelligence System

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major revenue challenge for subscription-based businesses.
This project builds an end-to-end customer retention intelligence system that analyzes customer behavior, predicts churn risk using machine learning, explains churn drivers, and provides actionable business recommendations.

The project is designed to reflect real-world analytics and data science work done in product and growth teams.
